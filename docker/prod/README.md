# Docker for production

This is not a complete solution, but a starting point. A Dockerfile that build the Hypha app with all dependencies are provided.

Anyone using this will need to add a Postgres container and a Nginx (or equivalent) container.


Please play around with it and suggest improvements at <https://github.com/HyphaApp/hypha/issues>.

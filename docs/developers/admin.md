# Menu items: an overview

The WagTail Admin is your "back office" for setting up form applications and publishing Funds. This interface is also where you could set different levels of permissions and access for user roles or groups. You could use the admin menu (or explorer menu)to navigate through different sections of the WagTail Admin.

- Groups: Create user groups with a specific set of permissions
- Sites: Managing the list of sites served by this Wagtail instance. Define settings that are editable by administrators in the Wagtail admin. These settings can be accessed in code, as well as in templates.
- Collections: Access to specific sets of images and documents can be controlled by setting up ‘collections’. By default all images and documents belong to the ‘root’ collection, but users with appropriate permissions can create new collections through the Settings -> Collections area of the admin interface.
- Redirects: When dealing with publishing and unpublishing pages you will eventually need to make redirects. A redirect ensures that when a page is no longer available (404), the visitor and search engines are sent to a new page. Therefore the visitor won’t end up in a breaking journey which would result in a page not found.

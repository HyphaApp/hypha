# Deployment

!!! info
    The domain settings between the development & production deployment tutorial differ: **Production** assumes Hypha will be running on a subdomain (ie. `apply.server.domain`). **Development** assumes Hypha will be running locally using `hypha.test`.

    These settings can be configured, just ensure they are consistent throughout.

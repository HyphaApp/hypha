# Deploying For Production

## Considering Hypha?

If you are considering deploying Hypha, there are several ways to deploy it. It includes a Django web application \(python\), and requires a PostgreSQL database server, and Nginx \(or Apache\) web server.

### [Stand Alone](stand-alone.md)

This requires a Linux server (It has been tested with Ubuntu, but should work with any flavor\).

### [Heroku](heroku.md)

This is the primary way Hypha has been deployed so far. It is fairly straightforward and well-tested

### [Docker](docker.md)

This deployment so far has been tested and used only for development purposes, but should theoretically work for production deployment.

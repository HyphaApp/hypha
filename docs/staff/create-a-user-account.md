## Create User Accounts

In the WagTail Admin, you could create a new user account as well as assign a role to a user account by clicking on the "Add User" button on the far right-hand corner of the screen. You can also search for users in the search bar. User roles are essential to WagTail and the Hypha platform. System Administrators are able to oversee user accounts and manage the level of access for different users.

## User Roles vs. User Groups

User Group refers to every account within this particular group. 

Go to Settings -> Groups. Clicking on the group name, e.g. "Staff", takes you to the permission page where you set what wagtail permissions staff should have. For example, system administrators could adjust the administrative access or permissions of every account or individual with the "Staff" user role.

## Filter Roles and Status

You could quickly search for user groups and their status (ie active or inactive) using the filter. The search function shows the user account's most recent login date.

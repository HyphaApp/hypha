# Select a Workflow

The **Workflow** defines the stages and processes that the application should undertake with OTF. Creating a new Fund or Lab requires you to select one of these workflows.

Each workflow has a predetermined amount of stages (e.g. request, proposal), application forms, review forms, and determination forms associated with this Fund or Lab.

Each workflow offers different statuses (e.g. External Review, Ready for Determination), and different actions (e.g Invite to proposal).

The four hard-coded workflows are: Request, Request with external review, Request with community review, Concept & Proposal.

### üíÅ Request
